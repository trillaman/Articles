# Articles

##### Hi! I'm **trillaman** 
and this part of my github is with articles **I will write** from time to time **about my projects and activities.**
It's **kind of a blog** where maybe some of you will find **useful informations** or methods for things you are doing.
**I will try to write once a week**, about many different categories like ones related to security, networks, OS'es and so on.
Maybe there will be also category about repairing stuff - I got few things to repair and recently I fixed TV without knowledge about it - **it still works** ;)

**Categories that will show up for sure are:**
* Security
* Operating systems
* Networks
* Some scripting
* Electronics repairs
**Enjoy while reading!**
